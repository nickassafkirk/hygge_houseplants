* Contact form Tutorial - To add a contact form functionality to the project, I used a guide from this
[learndjango.com tutorial](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-email-contact-form)

* Custom image upload button and styles were utilised as shown in the Code institutue boutique ado code along project   
[Widgets.py](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1/blob/master/products/widgets.py)   
[Template used](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1/blob/master/products/templates/products/custom_widget_templates/custom_clearable_file_input.html)   
[The CSS below was sourced from this link](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1/blob/master/static/css/base.css)  

    ```
    .btn-file {  
    position: relative; 
    overflow: hidden;   
    }

    .btn-file input[type="file"] {
        position: absolute; 
        top: 0; 
        right: 0;   
        min-width: 100%;    
        min-height: 100%;   
        opacity: 0; 
        cursor: pointer;    
    }   

    .custom-checkbox .custom-control-label::before {    
        border-radius: 0;   
        border-color: #dc3545;  
    }   

    .custom-checkbox .custom-control-input:checked~.custom-control-label::before {  
        background-color: #dc3545;  
        border-color: #dc3545;  
        border-radius: 0;   
    }
    ```

* jQuery UI slideToggle easing easeOutBounce - to create a more engaging user experience for the index page Hygge section, jQuery's .slideToggle() method was used.
  I was made aware of the additional slideToggle easing effects at [this stackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6121255/toggle-div-with-easing) from contributor Sylvain.

* Add image preview when image is added to add product form - to provide user feedback when an image is uploaded, I used a custom javascript script to render a small thumbnail image preview of the uploaded image. The core functionality of this script was inspired from [this stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22245100/how-to-display-an-image-from-a-file-input) from Nephelococcygia.

    ```
    function myFunction() {
        var file = document.getElementById('file').files[0];
        var reader  = new FileReader();
        // it's onload event and you forgot (parameters)
        reader.onload = function(e)  {
            var image = document.createElement("img");
            // the result image data
            image.src = e.target.result;
            document.body.appendChild(image);
        }
        // you have to declare the file loading
        reader.readAsDataURL(file);
    }
    ```

* To load existing product variants I used the queryset arguement [as outlined in the Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/modelforms/#changing-the-queryset)

* To disable the product form when editing product variants I used the technique of wrapping the form fields in a fieldset and assigning that fieldset with the ```disabled="disabled"```
attribute. This techniques was found in [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3507958/how-can-i-make-an-entire-html-form-readonly)

* Center text in ```<input type="number">``` I used information found in [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23715881/center-text-in-html-number-input) to control the appearance of
the default number input adjust buttons and to center the text.

    ```
    input[type='number']::-webkit-inner-spin-button, 
    input[type='number']::-webkit-outer-spin-button { 
        -webkit-appearance: none;
        margin: 0;
    }
```

#### Bugs Fixed:
* Variant delete functionality not operating as anticipated. When creating the delete variant functionality [djangos in built can_delete method](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/forms/formsets/#can_delete) was used. When the form was submitted, products were not being deleted. Using print statements it was determined that while the variant was being deleted, it was then subsequently being recreated with the same id when, the save() method was called on each form in the formset. To fix this bug the variant delete functionality was called after the form was saved to ensure that the variant is not recreated. 

* When trying to remove Products with variants from the cart. The variant id attribute is extracted from a unique item_id, this variant id is the key for each variant object in the cart session variable. 

eg. ```
    {product_id: {'product_variants': {variant_id: item_quantity}}}
    ```

When taking trying this initially I was experiencing an issue where the product variant was not being removed from the cart. To debug this I checked if the variant_id was a string, it returned True each time. I then checked if the variant was None with a if statement and I added a secondary print statement to check the value of the variant_id variable again. I found that it was returning as an int, which meant that when I tried to delete the variant object from the cart dictionary it was looking for an index of the dictionary that didn't exist instead of calling a dictionary key. To remedy this I explicitly converted the variant_id variable to a string so that the correct dictionary key is selected when the del keyword is used. 

See code below:

    ```
    try:
            product_id = None
            variant_id = None

            if "-" in item_id:
                product_id = item_id.split('-')[0]
                variant_id = request.POST.get('variant')

                print(isinstance(product_id, str))
                print(isinstance(variant_id, str))
            else:
                product_id = item_id

            cart = request.session.get('cart', {})

            if variant_id:
                print(variant_id)
                print(type(variant_id))
                del cart[product_id]['product_variants'][str(variant_id)]
    ```
